These are my notes I took from the 'Head first design patterns' book with the help of the [Christopher Okhravi](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChristopherOkhravi) youtube channel. 
## What is meant by design patterns?  
Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem. That means a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. By using design patterns, you can make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.
