# Book notes
Notes from programming books.  
This project was originally just a markdown notes from a programming book, 
but I thought this idea is meant to be bigger for a better reasons, so I developed this project with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).  
## Available scripts
```
$ npm install
```
This will install all dependencies needed.
```
$ npm run start
```
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
## Contributions
All kind of contributions from adding new features to the website to adding your own programming books notes are welcome ❤️.
